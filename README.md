# Expense-Tracker
An app that tracks weekly and monthly expenses and generates corresponding charts.

How to Run the Code:

1. Clone the Repository:
To get started, you'll need to clone this repository to your local device. You can do this by clicking on the "Clone" button and copying the repository's URL.

2. Set Up a Local Web Server:
Since we're using JavaScript, you'll need a local web server to run the project. 
Don't worry; it's easier than it sounds! If you don't have one already, there are various options available online. 
Personally, I recommend using the 'Live Server' extension for Visual Studio Code.
Simply install the appropriate package, and you're ready to go.

3. Open the Project:
Navigate to the project's main folder on your local device. 
Inside, you should find the HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and the two pictures in separate folders. 
Now, launch your local web server and open the HTML file in your preferred browser.
